Using with Modtronix SBC PIC 18.

Ross's Comments from Summer 2008:
To compile code make sure the right picc18.exe is in the enviroment variable 
path, I'm using the pro trial version right now. the command to compile is:
picc18 --chip=18F258 ain.c crc.c lcd.c i2c.c serial.c xtend.c delay.c config.c modbus.c main.c

I don't think the order is to terribly important. I wrote a batch file that has
this command in it, it should be in the output folder. The hex file created from
 compilation is called whatever the first file you typed was .hex so right now
its always ain.hex.


USART Registers:
RCIF - this is the recieve register flag, its what's polled in rcif_poll. When
the recieve register fills up, this flag is set.

The transmit reisters are used in serial.c but I've never touched them.

TXSTA, RCSTA - contains 7 configuration bits for transmition and reception
respectively, I don't think these will need to be fiddled with.

SPBRG - Baud rate generator register.


AIN Registers:
ACON0, ADCON1 - configuration registers.

ADON - this bit in ADCON0 turns the A/D on and off
